<p> the main issue i had was the website looking dull , i tried adding color to the background , navigation bar and even an image , but something seemed off. Then after 15mins of thinking i had an idea of using gradients instead of blank colors. At first i was not sure if there would be gradients in css and html but then after checking w3schools i found the answer : background: linear-gradient(to right, #fdfbfb , #ebedee);
adding this to any css groups will allow you to control the direction in which the gradient beginds and ends and what colors to use. </p>
